// The first type of access control occurs when a method in one class tries
// to access a method or variable of another class, using the dot
// operator (.) to invoke a method or retrieve a variable.

// The second type of access revolves around which, if any, members of a superclass
// a subclass can access through inheriting a member of another class and accessing 
// a member of another class using a reference of an instance of that class.
